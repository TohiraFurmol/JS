# JS
## JavaScript :
> JavaScript, also called JS for short, is one of the most popular 
> programming languages. JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, object-
> oriented, and interpreted language that supports a variety of 
> programming styles. This language can be used for server side 
> programming, mobile applications, games and desktop 
> applications. Therefore, it can be considered that the JavaScript 
> programming language is a versatile language.


# A BRIEF HISTORY OF JAVASCRIPT :
- 1995 very first version of Javascript in just 10 days.
- 1996 JavScript has almost nothing to do with Java ☝🏻
- 2009 ES5 (ECMAScript 5) is released with lots of great new features.
- 2015 the biggest to the language ever!
- Release of ES2016 / ES2017 / ES2018 / ES2019 / ES2020 / ES2021 / .../ ES2089 😂


## Var
```sh
- var is used in the older versions
of JavaScript

- var is function scoped (well be discussed
in later tutorials).

- For example, var x;
```


## Let
```sh
- let is the new way of declaring variables
starting ES6 (ES2015).

- let is block scoped (will be discussed in
later tutorials).

- For example, Let y;
```


## Const
```sh
- const keyword indicates that
the value of a variable is a
constant ES6(ES2015).

- const
scope is defined as
'block scoped

- For example, const n
```

# OBJECTS AND PRIMITIVES :
### Value -> Objects  or  Primitives
#### Primitives :
```sh
> Number
> String  
> Boolean
> Undefined
> Null
> Symbol
> Biglnt
```

#### Objects :
```sh
> Object literal
> Arrays
> Functions
> Many more...
```

## The 7 PRIMITIVES  DATA TYPES :
- Number: Floating point numbers Used for decimals and integers   Let age = 23 ;
- String: Sequence of characters - Used for text   Let firstName = 'Jonas';
- Boolean: Logical type that can only be true or false Used for taking decisions.   Let fullAge = true;
- Undefined: Value taken by a variable that is not yet defined ('empty value')   Let children;
- Null: Also means 'empty value'
- Symbol (ES2015): Value that is unique and cannot be changed (Not useful for now]
- Bignt (ES2020): Larger integers than the Number type can hold

#  JavaScript Variables :

1. Variable names must start with either a letter, an underscore _, or the dollar sign $.
2. Variable names cannot start with numbers. For example:
let 1simpleText = 'Javascript is really simple'; ❌
console.log(1simpleText);
