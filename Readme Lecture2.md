# What is Scope in JavaScript ?
>
> The scope is the current context of execution in which values and expressions
> are "visible" or can be referenced. If a variable or expression is not in the current
> scope, it will not be available for use. Scopes can also be layered in a hierarchy, 
> so that child scopes have access to parent scopes, but not vice versa.
